              </div>
              <p>The challenges of managing both the threat and opportunity posed by human waste have become a daunting one on the continent of Africa. Most Africa countries have close to no strategy, policy, political will to combat the menace and its far-reaching effects. Unfortunately, the larger percentage of the population in Africa suffers the adverse effect of the poor management of waste, with women and children being the most affected. Most dumpsites are located in a densely populated rural areas or slum where majority are living in abject poverty. Arbitrary dumpsites are also common sight on road kerbs and corners even in the urban areas where the local authorities have been practically overwhelmed by the challenges of Municipal Solid Waste, E-waste and hazardous waste like medical and chemical wastes.</p>

            <p>Certainly, there must be a deliberate systematic and sustainable approach which is scientific and technical in nature to curtail the negative effects of uncontrolled waste dump in Africa. This approach must be all inclusive to guarantee sustainability. Without this, achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in Africa by 2030 may be a mere wish. Especially on</p>
